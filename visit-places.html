        <h3 class="article__subtitle">Székesfehérvár</h3>
        <p class="article__paragraf">
          This city is very close to Budapest and was called ‘the City of the
          Kings’. Not only did it play the main role in coronation of the
          royals of Hungarian Empire, but it has a looong past too - it was
          inhabited in the 10th century B.C.! Currently, it has around 95 000
          inhabitants.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraf">
          You’d definitely love to visit this place! It has many many
          historical buildings but not only that... It has many events, as it
          is rich in atractions! That is mainly thanks to 40 schools in
          Székesfehérvár.
        </p>
        <ul class="article__list">
          <li>
            <span>Hetedhét Toy Museum</span>- various toys from across the
            ages. Even from the ancient monarchs themselves!
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Black Eagle’s Chemist Shop</span>-a museum displaying how
            drugs ( medicine of course) were made from herbs and what tools
            the pharmacists had been using
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Árpád Bath</span>-this is one of the most beloved
            destination of its kind. Just chill and relax in the hot pools in
            this resort and enjoy the life. It is sooo worth it :)

          <h3 class="article__subtitle">Sopron</h3>
          <p class="article__paragraf">
            This city’s status is truly exceptional - ‘The Most Loyal Town’ (
            Civitas Fidelissima). When Trianon happened and Hungary lost its
            parts, Sopron’s 68% majority voted for staying Hungarian. The city
            is located close to the Neusiedl lake, next to the Austrian borders.
            Thanks to this fact, the inhabitants are usually bilingual.
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraf">
            What’s truly exceptional is the architecture and its long past - I
            mean rich history. It is totally common that you’ll see Renessaince,
            Baroque and medieval structures!
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraf">What’s more?</p>
          <p class="article__paragraf">
            The foundations from the Roman Empire! All these elements display
            ages and ages of stability and prosperity.

          <h3 class="article__subtitle">Debrecen</h3>
          <p class="article__paragraf">
            Debrecen was actually the former capital city of Hungary! And also
            it is the second largest city in Hungary. Thic city was also know as
            the ‘Calvinist Rome’ or ‘the Capital of the Great Hungarian Plain’
            and has a Golden church which is its biggest pride. Both sadly and
            luckily, you won’t find many English speakers there.
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraf">
            That allows you to feel the kindness and warmth of the Debrecen’s
            people. :)
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraf">
            That is the biggest pride, however, you will find there dozens of
            other atractions there such as:
          </p>
          <ul class="article__list">
            <li>
              <span>Hetedhét Toy Museum</span>- works as a restaurant, bar, and
              exhibition venue
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Black Eagle’s Chemist Shop</span> - a heartful memorial for
              those who attempted to free Hungary in 1956 from Soviet
              dictatorship.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Árpád Bath</span>- most well-known non-musical festival in
              HU. In August for one week, the city is floating in colours and
              flowers. Apert that, you’ll experience traditional dances, music,
              and various types of artristry.
