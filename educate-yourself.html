            Cultural appropiation is very important. One needs to know what to
            avoid or aim for. There are some things which trigger not the best
            reaction.

            Hungary is considered a sturdy country where they more-less don’t
            care about foreign cultural appropriation. For their consistent
            culture, there is no significant need to make a stand.

            But if you though Magyars are not sensitive to their national
            traits, you are a biiit wrong.

                <h5>Magyars LOVE food</h5>
                <p>
                  If you ever go to Hungary or meet Magyars, they love
                  experimenting with food much. Not only that but they do damn
                  love their cusine. It mainly consists of paprika, sour cream,
                  meat, and potatoes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are vegan by chance, don’t worry! All their delicious
                  recipes can be done in a vegan way too!
                </p>
                <p>Nonetheless, their love for food overcomes all obstacles</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Magyars have rich heritage</h5>
                <p>
                  From the national to the global aspect, Magyars have much in
                  account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This also supports huge nationalism, as they their empire
                  ruled for over hundred of years and was one among the
                  wealthiest in Europe. Their culture is rich customs and their
                  own meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Half Magyars or non-Hungarian people living outside of Hungary
                  but speaking Hungarian often tend to mark themselves as proud
                  Magyars. Those people feel strong and proud connection to what
                  Hungary achieved.

                <h5>FOOD</h5>
                <p>
                  As much as they love food, they are highly sensitive about
                  their cuisine. It comes with complex traditions and you should
                  never critisize the meal and wine that a fellow Magyar
                  prepared.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Especially, if they come ( food and wine origin) from the same
                  region as your fellow Magyar pal.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>History</h5>
                <p>
                  Hungary has undergone many economic upheveals. They view the
                  history as something darker and may not want to revisit it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you do talk about it, pay attention to your counterpart -
                  Magayars tend to be very sensitive when it comes to losing
                  their wealth in the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They are direct talkers though and don’t mess with anything :)
